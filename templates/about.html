    <p>
      The <strong>a11y PDF Audit</strong> is a modular web application designed to automatically check websites for accessible PDF files.
      It crawls any given URL, downloads discovered PDFs, validates them using VeraPDF,
      and generates structured HTML and PDF reports automatically.
      <br>
      <strong>VeraPDF</strong> is a purpose-built, open source, file-format validator covering all PDF/A and PDF/UA parts and conformance levels.

        German Federal Monitoring Agency for Accessibility in Information Technology
      </h2>
      The Federal Monitoring Agency for Accessibility of Information Technology (BFIT-Bund) began its work in autumn 2019.
      It was established on the basis of Section 13(3) of the Disability Equality Act (BGG).
      As the federal monitoring body, BFIT-Bund performs tasks assigned to Germany by the European Union (EU) Directive on the monitoring,
      review and reporting of digital services provided by public bodies. (Section 8 of Directive (EU) 2016/2102)
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Many people don't know that PDFs actually have to be barrier-free. There are still misunderstandings, e.g. some people say that PDFs are not a website - but it is clear, and PDFs must be just as accessible. I would like to clarify that.

  <h2 id="MainFeatures">Main Features (Some are New in Version 1.2.0)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      🔍 <strong>Dual-Audit System:</strong> Validates PDFs simultaneously against the strict ISO PDF/UA-1 standard AND our custom, pragmatic <strong>ScreenReadable</strong> profile
      (ignoring visual font metrics and strict matrix algorithms that don't affect screen readers like JAWS/NVDA).
    </li>
    <li>
      🌐 <strong>Recursive Crawler:</strong> Searches websites for downloadable PDFs (configurable depth & limit) with smart error handling.
    </li>
    <li>
      📊 <strong>Reporting:</strong> Generates detailed reports in JSON, HTML, and PDF formats (using WeasyPrint) with side-by-side Strict vs. ScreenReadable results.
    </li>
    <li>
      💻 <strong>Web Interface:</strong> Easy-to-use Flask frontend with live server logs and report overview.
    </li>
    <li>
      🚀 <strong>Resilient Processing:</strong> Intelligent timeout handling with dynamic multipliers (x4) for large PDFs to prevent crashes.
    </li>
    <li>
      🧹 <strong>Auto-Cleanup:</strong> Automatically deletes reports older than 14 days to preserve server storage.
    </li>
    <li>
      ⚙️ <strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> Config-driven setup (via `config.json`), separated CSS, and Facade & Controller patterns for scalability (Docker/Fly.io ready).
    </li>
    <li>
      💯 <strong>Perfect Performance:</strong> Achieves 100/100 in Google PageSpeed Insights (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="LimitationsIssues">Limitations and Issues</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>VeraPDF vs. axesCheck (PAC)</strong>
    There is a known discrepancy between <strong>VeraPDF</strong> (used by this tool) and
    <strong>axesCheck/PAC</strong> regarding ISO 14289-1:2014 (PDF/UA-1), specifically rule <strong>7.5 (Tables)</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>VeraPDF</strong> tends to be very strict and may report `FAIL` on tables where the headers cannot be determined
      <strong>algorithmically</strong> according to its strict interpretation of the standard.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>axesCheck</strong> might pass the same file if the logical structure is semantically sufficient for screen readers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Version 1.2.0 introduces the <strong>ScreenReadable Profile</strong> alongside the strict check to bridge this gap.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="bg-gray-box">
    <h3>Solution: The "ScreenReadable" Profile</h3>
    <p>
      To bridge the gap between strict ISO validators and real-world screen reader behavior (like JAWS, NVDA, or axesCheck), this tool runs a dual-audit.
      First test against the strict PDF/UA-1 standard,
      and than against a custom <strong>ScreenReadable</strong> profile, which ignores visual font metrics and strict matrix checks.

  <h2 id="Performance">Performance</h2>
  <p>
    This instance runs on a minimal container configuration (1GB RAM).
    To ensure stability, concurrent processing is limited.
    If you need to audit very large websites or process thousands of PDFs,
    please consider deploying your own instance using the Docker image or running the tool locally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note: The download directory containing generated reports is <strong>automatically deleted after 14 days</strong>.
    Make sure to download your reports beforehand!
